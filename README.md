# Kaomojis ٩(•̤̀ᵕ•̤́๑)

# So what is this ?

Well I like Kaomojis, so im tempted to either do the following

- Implement this with splatemoji *Which would make this very simple*
- Make a custom small gui where both windows and linux users can enjoy the use
of god tier kaomojis. The second one seems more appealing.
